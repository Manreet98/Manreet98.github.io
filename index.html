            <p>Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms have revolutionized the way we consume media and entertainment, fundamentally changing the landscape of content distribution. Emerging in the early 2010s, these internet-based streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ have disrupted traditional television and film distribution models. By offering on-demand access to a vast library of movies, TV shows, and original content, OTT platforms have provided consumers with unprecedented flexibility, allowing them to watch content anytime, anywhere, and on any device. The rise of high-speed internet, smartphone proliferation, and changing viewer preferences have accelerated the growth of these platforms, making them a dominant force in global entertainment consumption.</p>
