            Over-the-top (OTT) platforms have revolutionized the way people consume entertainment. 
            Unlike traditional cable or satellite TV, OTT services deliver content directly over the internet. 
            Services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Hotstar have gained immense popularity worldwide. 
            The flexibility to watch content anytime, on any device, has made OTT platforms extremely convenient. 
            Additionally, they offer personalized recommendations based on viewer preferences, enhancing user experience.

            The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the rise of OTT platforms as cinemas and theaters shut down. 
            Many production houses started releasing their films directly on these platforms. 
            With increasing competition, OTT services are investing heavily in original content to retain subscribers. 
            This shift signifies a major transformation in the entertainment industry, making OTT the future of media consumption.
